# A little experiment with Principal Component Analysis
This consists of my first thought experiment with commonly used data analysis techniques.

My dear friend and roommate, who conveniently works as a Data Scientist for a consulting firm, was kind enough to share one of his notebooks with me. 

His notebook boils down to a submission in Kaggle's famous competition about Titanic survivors, inputing processed data into different models and comparing results of varying hyperparameters.

Before inputing the data to the different models, he used a common technique called PCA (Principal Component Analysis, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). He chose to apply this technique on his full data set, still containing the target (y) variable. So, after a moment of consideration I asked him if this could create a source of data leakage. We discussed and we couldn't reach an agreement.

Therefore, I decided to make my first notebook focused on answering this question. More details will be provided inside the Jupyter notebook.
